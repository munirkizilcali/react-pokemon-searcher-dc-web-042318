# JS Pokemon Search Assignment

## Objectives

- DOM Manipulation
- Events and Event Handlers
- Callbacks
- Constructors and Prototypes or ES6 Classes (For part two)

Hello, your assignment today is to re-create the functionality of our [Pokemon search engine](https://pokemon-search.netlify.com/).

p.s. Don't forget to include the ability to toggle the card image and reset the card image upon submission of a new search.

## Instructions

We're building out a search feature in our application (no backend persistence). A user should be able to search for a Pokemon and flip that Pokemon card to see the back side.

In addition to listing out each pokemon card with the pokemon's details,
  1. Implement a filter functionality for your Pokemon list.
  2. Implement a flip functionality on each Pokemon.


*How can we access the pokemon data that is located in data.js ?*
